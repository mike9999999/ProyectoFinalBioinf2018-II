In this repository we find the project developed in the Introduction to Bioinformatics and Reproducible Research for Genetic Analysis class.
The project has the name Effect of short-term early overnutrition on the transcriptome of adipose tissue.

This project consists in general of a relative expression studies where the genomic expression of 2 groups of samples is contrasted, in this case the projects are developed in an environment of organisms with an overnutrition treatment and a control group.

In this project a work structure is developed that will include folders to organize the information of the scripts, images, data and results.
